**git diff**

That command compares what is in your working directory with what is in your staging area. The
result tells you the changes you’ve made that you haven’t yet staged.

If you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can use `git diff
--staged`. This command compares your staged changes to your last commit.
